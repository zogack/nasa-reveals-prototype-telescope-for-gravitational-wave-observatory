# NASA Reveals Prototype Telescope For Gravitational Wave Observatory
NASA has revealed a full-scale prototype for six telescopes designed to detect gravitational waves. Phys.Org reports: The LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission is led by ESA (European Space Agency) in partnership with NASA to detect gravitational waves by using lasers to measure precise distances -- down to picometers, or trillionths of a meter -- between a trio of spacecraft distributed in a vast configuration larger than the sun. Each side of the triangular array will measure nearly 1.6 million miles, or 2.5 million kilometers. The Engineering Development Unit Telescope, which was manufactured and assembled by L3Harris Technologies in Rochester, New York, arrived at Goddard in May. The primary mirror is coated in gold to better reflect the infrared lasers and to reduce heat loss from a surface exposed to cold space, since the telescope will operate best when close to room temperature. The prototype is made entirely from an amber-colored glass-ceramic called Zerodur, manufactured by Schott in Mainz, Germany. The material is widely used for telescope mirrors and other applications requiring high precision because its shape changes very little over a wide range of temperatures. The LISA mission is slated to launch in the mid-2030s.
